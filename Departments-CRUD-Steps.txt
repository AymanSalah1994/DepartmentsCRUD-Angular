1-Creating the Project

2- ($ npm install bootstrap )

3- Creating the Model
  - $ ng generate class _models/department --skip-tests

4-Instead Of Making a Big "Parent" Component that Take/Get Data From Children ,
We Will Make a Service that acts as the Container Of Data
  - This Container is a Class With CRUD functions
  - Using Depencey Injection

5- ( $ ng g s _services/departmentService) >>
  ( $ ng g s _services/department ) >> BETTER
  DON'T INCLUDE service Word in the Command , It will Generated Automatically
  - Command To Create the Service .


6-Now Each Components will Use the Data From the Service , It will Take the data
Inside its TypeScript File Using DIC "Depencey Injection" Inside the CTOR of the Component
